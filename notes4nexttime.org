#+Title: Notes for Next Time (S2023 edition)

* Purpose
Short, stream-of-conscious notes for things I may try to do, or re-do before the next offering.

* Things to consider changing
1. How we depend on Linux.
   I still feel that getting familiarity with a second operatings system and its tools is useful, but this is weighed against the challenge of supporting such a diverse range of student capbabilities and different hardward. The VM machine is easy to get started, but hard to maintain. I had students creating 12gb virtual hard drives, and certain software (such as the Psychopy library) does not always install smoothly in this environment.
   1. Things to try: Can I get all the windows users using WSL2 for Linux?
   2. Can all the Mac users get the tools they need through their native terminal and homebrew?
2. Redo some of the videos.
   As interfaces change or even how arguments are listed the small changes can have a big effect on student comprehension. The demo videos seem quite successful. I should probably remake them (eventually all of them) to take account of the minor, but still confusing to new comers, changse that occur from version to version.
3. Replace hangman with something more structured to introduce writing both .R and .py files?
   Some students still don't get the hang of writing functions they can import and reuse. I still see very long scripts. Maybe this can just be made more structured with specific steps, or I can just grow the data analyses to include these components and stretch them out over time.
4. Replace psychopy
   The original goal for psychopy was an easy to use tool for coding experiments. The psychopy people have focused so heavily on the builder that the coder interface is hard to access. Also, the javascript and other components now seem to be the priority. Alas, it seems that psychopy is basically becoming e-prime. I don't want students learning to use a /particular/ tools, but rather learning how to use tools generally. For this reason I think it may be better to use pygame directly. That should be good enough here. The practice components I build up to, instead of just a simple posner cuing, could use words and pictures and RT. Also, a better way to handle data and save to file could better equip students for after the course.

   Also noted that the '/' key doesn't work anymore unless you use the name 'slash'.
5. Emacs 29 with =citeproc= and =org-cite=
   Should be much easier for the citation components. Will this be part of the -buntu offerings? If not, show how to install from source?
6. Students noticed a mismatch between learn and github:
   #+begin_quote
   > On GitHub, it states that we need at least one plot, and that the introduction and discussion must have at least one citation
  > each. On LEARN, youâ€™ve asked that we have two plots and at least five citations. Which guidelines should we follow?
  #+end_quote
7. Look at seaborn package to make for easier nicer plotting in python?
8. Citing figures (or at least acknowledge sources)
9. Reference/cite your use of computational and statistical software. Not just the statistical method but which version of R/Psychopy and any other packages.
10. Discuss possibly a package for Rmd to mix python with R code? [[https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/articles/r_markdown.html][Reticulate]]
11. Another VM option for newer macs? Yet to try: [[https://eclecticlight.co/virtualisation-on-apple-silicon/][Viable]].
12. Former student had an interesting idea of pairing students from more technical backgrounds with more junior students. Maybe that might help get over code paralysis. Could do it as a mini-group project with hangman?
13. A citation to justify why they have to document their analytical choices: https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03177-1
14. An [[https://github.com/james-stoup/emacs-org-mode-tutorial#org56377d5][org mode]] guide that might be useful?
15. Use a pandoc workflow for the report writing?
16. There is a nice update to citation handling that I should adapt. It is well described in this [[https://amerygration.com/Blog/citation_handling_in_emacs.html][recent blog post]].

* Other links to include?
1. An [[https://neuro4ml.github.io/][online course]] I have not had a chance to look at yet. Might be good for 420.
